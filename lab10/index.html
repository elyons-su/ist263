        <p>I am a Junior majoring in Advertising with minors in Information Management and Technology and Sociology. I enjoy working collaboratively and expressing my creativity with others. This past summer I worked virtually as an Account Strategy Intern at Dotdash, a digital publishing company. I have danced almost my entire life, enjoy listening to music, spending time with my family, and going on hikes with my dog Chucky. I am an avid list maker, fashion trend watcher, and sushi enthusiast.</p>
